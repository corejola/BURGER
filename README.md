## How to use the Eat-Da-Burger App
1. Type in the burger you wish to eat and submit to the burger database.
    * You may add as many burgers as you wish
2. You burgers will be displayed on the page.
3. Once you have devoured a burger, hit the `devoured` button to remove it from the list and add it to the devoured list. 

## Functionality (ORM)
1. Eat-Da-Burger application utilizes the MVC architecture to interface between the HTML page and the SQL burger database. 
2. Object Relational Mapping `ORM` is utilized to create the SQL statement functions into an exportable object. 

## Functionality (SEQUELIZE) - INCOMPLETE

* see Pseudo Code Below

### Pseudo Code:
#### MODEL:
1. Model to handle the "How" of the application
2. Burger.js Model created using Sequelize CLI using the following CLI commands:
    * `npx sequelize-cli init`
    * `npx sequelize-cli model:generate --name Burger --attributes ame:text,devoured:boolean`   
3. Data validation incorporated after model was created `notEmpty: true`
4. config.json updated to reflect MYSQL credentials
 

#### VIEW: 


#### CONTROLER:
1. Controller to handle the "where" & the "what 
2. burgers_controller.js requires the Burger Model peforms the CRUD operations
3. API routes are established within the controller
    * `app.get("/")` peforms a `db.Burger.findAll` using sequelize synatx to retrive all items from the burgers_db
    * `app.post("/api/burger")`
        `db.Burger.create`
    * `app.put("/api/burger/:id")`
        `db.Burger.update`
    * `app.delete("/api/burger/:id")`
        `db.Burger.destroy`
